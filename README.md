# Restaurant Search Application
## _The most powerful restaurant search in the world_

Search our restaurants.csv database for a list of personalized recommendations.

This project is a C# console application that can be launched from Visual Studio. Once the project is launched, please ensure that the CSVHelper NuGet package is  installed. Once this is done, run the application and follow the command prompt to search for new restaurants (null values are acccepted as search parameters). Please note that both CSV paths (Lines 19 and 21 of Program.cs) may need to be updated to reflect your local environment.
